# Arithmetic-Encoder-Decoder
**Arithmeticoder - A compact Utility Software allowing you to encode and decode a piece of text of your choice using arithmetic coding.** This piece of software was a sideproject of mine and is based on some of the curriculum we had in my second semester of university, having to do with compression algorithms.

# How it works:
For information on how Arithmetic Coding works, refer to this short but easy to understand [guide](https://go-compression.github.io/algorithms/arithmetic/).

# Releases
An executable version of the app is available as .exe (windows) and .deb (Linux) files in the *Release* Section of this Repository. 
A macOS version and the possibility for an apt repo download will follow shortly. A flatpak version will also soon be available.
